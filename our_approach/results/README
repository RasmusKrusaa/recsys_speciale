genre_nn_loss1-5 type: [(loss, epoch)]
    NN trained with train1-5 users' genre answers and profiles
genre_rmse_test1-5 type: [(rmse, epoch)]
    computing profiles during training of NN for users in test1-5 - NN trained with
    train1-5 users' genre answers and their known profiles

    RMSE on predictions ((profile provided by NN *item profiles) + biases + global average)
    for test1-5 users.
genre_results_at_10_1-5 type: {metric: value}
    NN trained with genre answers and known profiles
    Computing profiles after training of NN for test users and with those measure metrics

random90: answers on items in the 90% of long tail
random98: answers on items in the 98% of long tail
mp: answers on most popular items (measured by number of times rated)
